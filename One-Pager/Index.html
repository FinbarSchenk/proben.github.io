                                Resident Evil 5 Remake and Resident Evil 6 Remake are two games being developed by Capcom,
                                focusing on multiplayer or coop horror elements. The original titles had coop aspects that
                                differed from previous titles, and the community had mixed opinions. However, the remakes
                                have generally received good reviews, although the community is not as large as the
                                original titles. The trend of previous remakes indicates that the community likes them,
                                and the coop aspect might follow the same trend, potentially leading to higher review
                                scores. The problem with the original titles was their shift from survival horror to action
                                survival horror, resulting in linear shooter gameplay with coop elements. Old RE veterans
                                disliked this change due to its linear and shooter-like gameplay. The hope for old veterans
                                and new players lies in Capcom using the remake option to address the "flaws" mentioned by
                                veterans and incorporate new perspectives. The lower creepiness factor remains an issue, but
                                Capcom could address this by making enemy models scarier and giving them a "creep under your
                                skin" aspect.
